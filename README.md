## Introduction to Capstone Project
In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting services firm renowned for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with evolving technologies and stay competitive in the market, the organization regularly conducts data analysis to identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, my primary responsibility was to assist with this initiative by collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. This capstone project aimed to provide valuable insights into the skills that will be in demand in the near future, enabling the organization to make informed decisions and maintain its competitive edge.
